Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness.

Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the \\"strange little book\\" or \\"the little black book\\" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was \\"The Counsels\\" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses\'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century.

Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as \\"the poet-prophet par-excellence\\" (incidentally one of Kahlil\'s mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, \\"extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern.\\" Wow that\'s a powerful critique...and let\'s listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:\\"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes.

Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran\'s best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam\'s prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart\'s knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in \'The Prophet.\' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran\'s collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname \'the Shelly of the Orient.\' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:\\"It is Gibran\'s gift to us, as well, for Gibran\'s prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world\'s great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \\"divinely inspired.\\"  Brian Bruya\\"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\\"  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gibran\'s Prophet-worthy Poetic Wisdom", "unixReviewTime": 1259452800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2009"}\n', '{"reviewerID": "A34HCSZJXZLPC", "asin": "000100039X", "reviewerName": "dinadan26 \\"dinadan26\\"", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewText": "Okay I know that Gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60\'s.It does not mean that he also isn\'t still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about.

While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn\'t really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter \\"Love\\", Gibran writes, \\"... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ...

Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man\'s laws or God\'s laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother\'s, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.

Covering the landscape from religion to love, Gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the Prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey.  The metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional.The book itself is nearly 100 pages, but the content is not readable at any level rapidly.

Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran\'s claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. \\"It Must be a cult,\\" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What\'s incredible is that there\'s absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics (\\"On Love\\", \\"On Work\\", \\"On Joy and Sorrow\\", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem \\"On Children\\" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, \\"Breaths.\\"\\"Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life\'s longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\\"At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent\'s roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a \\"middle ground\\" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in \\"unwinding\\" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What\'s more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran\'s contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of \\"The Prophet\\" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book\'s table of contexts either using Amazon\'s \\"Search Inside\\" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That\'s a good a place as any to start with.

It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  \\"Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, \'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?\'\\"Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all \\"cosmic\\" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: \\"He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.\\"Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this \\"It Takes a Village\\" gem: \\"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.\\"  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  \\"The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.\\"  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn\'t oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn\'t have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of \\"The Prophet\\" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:\\"Say not, \'I have found the truth,\' but rather, \'I have found a truth.\'  Say not, \'I have found the path of the soul.\' Say rather, \'I have met the soul walking upon my path.\'\\"Forget that Jesus said, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\\"  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole \\"one source, many wells\\" philosophy.  Don\'t believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  \\"Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to \'god\' in his own way!  He would never say that!\\"  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn\'t an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of \\"love thy neighbor\\" philosophy, it still defines \\"good\\" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a \\"do unto others\\" prescription, but \\"You are good when you are one with yourself.\\"If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, \\"Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.\\"  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (\\"a truth\\") to God:\\"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.\\"Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  \\"You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!\\"  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (\\"You are good when you are one with yourself,\\" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don\'t want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of \\"The Prophet.\\"  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran\'s thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that \\"The Prophet\\" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that \\"The Prophet\\" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word \\"hedon.\\"  \\"Hedonist\\" sounds like a philosophical school, as does \\"epicurean.\\"  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let\'s say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.

Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer \\"dwell in the solitude of your heart\\" so they \\"live in your lips.\\"As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his \\"ship arrives\\" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.\\"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?\\"The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: \\"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.\\"Almustafa only cries and doesn\'t seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran\'s mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran\'s attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as \\"her young prophet.\\"  She also wrote poems about Gibran\'s life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.\\"But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night.\\" ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Invisible Revealed", "unixReviewTime": 1117411200, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2005"}\n', '{"reviewerID": "A2Q41ZN25XIU8Q", "asin": "000100039X", "reviewerName": "Reema E.", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "When i ordered this book i knew it was worth it.

Therefore I\'ve taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran\'s writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, \\"Speak to us of Children.\\"And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life\'s longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer\'s hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "lyrically evokes your finest self", "unixReviewTime": 1100995200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2004"}\n', '{"reviewerID": "A27K3QNWUJ1MKH", "asin": "000100039X", "reviewerName": "T.

To be honest I have no idea why I downloaded this. I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that!  Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, \'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.\'The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you.  On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of \'The Prophet\' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his \'home\'.MarriageChildrenGivingEating and DrinkingWorkJoy and SorrowCrime and PunishmentFreedomReason and PassionPainTeachingFriendshipGood and EvilPrayerPleasureReligionDeathSo many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!I\'m not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible.  I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen.  But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran\'s words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Words of Wisdom for Everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}\n', '{"reviewerID": "A2E26N6KPFT2MY", "asin": "000100039X", "reviewerName": "Toragaiko", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Beautiful, wholly accessible, brought tears to my eyes.

Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.

Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life\'s timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today\'s memory and tomorrow is today\'s dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.

Walker \\"Home School Book Review\\"", "helpful": [11, 40], "reviewText": "\\"The Prophet\\" is Almustafa, called \\"the chosen and the beloved,\\" who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as \\"Prophet of God\\" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which \\"the Prophet\\" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of \\"inspirational fiction\\" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran\'s writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran\'s theology, \\"the Prophet\\" says, \\"Say not, `I have found the truth,\' but rather, `I have found a truth.\'\\"  Jesus said, \\"You shall know THE truth\\" (John 8:32), and, \\"I am the way, THE truth, and the life\\" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa\'s discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a \\"spiritual masterpiece,\\" so when I found it in my father\'s library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, \\"Ugh.\\"  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, \\"It\'s all Greek to me,\\" but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were \\"all Greek\\" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I\'ll just say it\'s all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet \\"brings to one\'s ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes.\\"  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn\'t mean that there\'s nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can\'t be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what \\"the Prophet\\" says about clothes.  \\"Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.\\"  Oh, by the way, even as simply \\"poetry\\" it just doesn\'t do anything for me.

Yet, Bainbridge captures more than just history, time, place, and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb. Early in the novel, Myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush, they float like dandelion seed up the wind-draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier. It is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time. The pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters. I almost think she wrote too little in this book. I would have loved to have the book twice as long. The character of Pompey Jones, the bisexual street urchin, is fascinating and I wish Bainbridge had written a novel just for this self-aware, self-assured, character to follow Master Georgie. Bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of Myrtle, and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover George Hardy. Myrtle and Pompey are both orphans, street wise, highly intelligent, and are recognized for their strengths by the Hardy family.George Hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden. As a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home, it appears that his service in the Crimean is somewhat of a penance, a sacrifice, for his sexuality. He strives to be the perfect son to his father, mother, and siblings, yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family. George Hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the Crimean War due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control. In some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the Victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation. George is contrasted with Pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality, recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women. The narrative of war is haunting, reminding me of the outstanding novels of Pat Barker about World War I. We read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body. It is the third narrator, Dr. Potter, George\'s brother-in-law that offers unique looks at all the other characters. Potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time. He lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident. Overall the book is excellent, a post-modern masterpiece, telling a complex tale from multiple points of view but never giving the `definitive\' story behind the story.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An historic novel of personal proportions", "unixReviewTime": 1281225600, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2010"}\n', '{"reviewerID": "A940CJE4B0AJ8", "asin": "0001055178", "reviewerName": "Darren in Kansas City \\"Darren in Kansas City\\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I\'d heard so much about Bainbridge...how she has been nominated (and overlooked) for the Booker five times...how her short novels are beloved by a cultish following.

I thought it nonsense that an illiterate girl in nineteenth century Liverpool could never write such exquisite prose as evidenced in  this novel, and that this was a case of the authorial voice being too  strong.  As it happened, I couldn\'t have been more wrong.  This novel is  narrated by the close acquaintances of \'Master Georgie\' (although some are  closer than others), starting with the illiterate Myrtle.  Immediately we  are drawn into the action, as this sequence of a photograph being taken  will resound throughout the novel.  \'Master Georgie\' is incredibly subtle,  and it is only by looking back over it that you begin to appreciate that  this is the most suitable of beginnings.  Here is where Myrtle begins on  her road to becoming a lady.  And what an unsavory road it is, as Myrtle\'s  help is initially required to cover up the manner in which George Hardy\'s  father has died, and leads to the bloody battlefields of the Crimea.  Also  assisting with the cover-up is the duck-boy and street urchin, Pompey Jones  and the pompous Dr. Potter, whose narrations are by far the best.  George  Hardy himself is an ambiguous figure, seen only through the eyes of others.  It may be a fault that we never really get to know him.  This is a novel  of cameras, carnality, and carnage.  The dreadful shadow of history is cast  upon it, with the famous charge of the Light Brigade lightly alluded to.  One almost expects to run into a lady with a lamp at every corner, but  fortunately, Bainbridge avoids this excess.  She takes events frozen in  time, such as the front cover\'s photograph, and brings them into life and  death, and maybe even beyond.  The camera never lies... Or does it?  Bainbridge fervently burrows into the psyche of characters, enabling them  to bring about apparitions vivid enough to be captured by film.  In my  mind\'s eye, I see Bainbridge pouring over ancient photographs from the  Crimea, trying to put names to faces and to see if she could walk around in  their bloody shoes.  She succeeds.  If I\'d have been on 1998\'s Booker  panel, I know I would have placed Bainbridge before McEwan.

This would be wrong. Master Georgie is no safe tale of country house manners, of marriages imagined by confined, embroidering young women. Beryl Bainbridge\'s Master Georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility.Master Georgie is a surgeon and photographer, and the book is cast in six plates - photographic plates, not chapters. Death figures throughout. From start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book\'s characters. We begin with Mr Moody, dead in a brothel bed, his host of minutes before in shock. Later we move to the Crimean War, where the carnage is graphic, extensive and apparently random. And even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering.The book uses multiple points of view. We see things Master Georgie\'s way. Myrtle, an orphan he takes in, adds her perspective. The fussy geologist, Dr Potter, imprints his own version of reality. And still there are less than explained undercurrents, undeclared motives which affect them all. Thus, overall, Master Georgie is a complex and ambitious novel. Though it is set in a major war, the backdrop is never allowed to dominate. The characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions, but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting.But we also never really get to know these people. Myrtle, perhaps, has the strongest presence. She has a slightly jaundiced, certainly pragmatic approach to life. But even she finds the privations of wartime tough. Why the characters of Master Georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself. And ultimately this was my criticism of Beryl Bainbridge\'s book. While the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking, I found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives. The beauty of the prose, however, more than made up for any shortcoming. The language created the mixed world of mid-nineteenth century politeness and juxtaposed this with the visceral vulgarities of soldiering and the general struggle of life.

It\'s ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George\'s father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George\'s sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It\'s like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It\'s the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got.

Her stories rarely have definitive separations between what actually happened, and what might have happened to the characters she creates. The Crimean War is the setting this time, and while historically noteworthy is not as familiar as some of her other subjects, like The Titanic, or the doomed Scott Expedition to the South Pole. What is consistent is her ability to jump about through time periods without ever losing credibility. Each of her books reads as if a unique pen is behind each one. The hand of course is the same, however the moods created are remarkably singular.The character that is the book\'s title is a complex human study, or if you prefer, a very intricate person but occupied with a mind and personality as muddled, as it is diverse. A grotesque death scene is the entrance for one of the narrator\'s of the book, an individual that would have lived as a street urchin but for chance, and an ambiguous bit of goodwill. A second street personality with many more wiles and flexible conduct also becomes a member of Master Georgie\'s entourage. This second narrator has a unique view of events, as he is close when Master Georgie requires, for the latter\'s sexuality is repressed at best. These are just two people who eventually head to the middle of The Crimean War, and the question that keeps shadowing the reader is why?Escape from the latter half of 19th century London is an easy answer for George, but what of the others? Taking a trip toward an impending war as George\'s groupies is one matter, staying in the midst of a war is much more puzzling. This is one of the most difficult of Ms. Bainbridge\'s books that I have read. Previous works have often served as a metaphor for the time they occupy, or the closing act in a World that is about to undergo great disruptive change. This work is not as apparently decisive.One characteristic is consistent, and that is her master\'s grasp of language. A lapful of cherries that serve as a metaphor will haunt a reader for some time. Her images of the dead and dying are less grotesquely graphic than most writers portray, but are far more disturbing than other wartime battles.

He continues on to explain the age of the earth that in Gen 1:3-31 was the restoration of the earth to its original condition before it was made \\"formless and void\\" and submerged in water and darkness and how there is millenniums of time that science may require for the formation of the earth as a planet.

Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania\'s childhood who became her sister\'s husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine.

My enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact I grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three.  Here is why:Part one is about a child named Grania growing up in Canada in the late 1800\'s.  A bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf.  Thankfully, Grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read.  I know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is.  Grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words.  Readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times.  When she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts.  The teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure Grania understands what is going on.  The children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her.  Most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb.  When Grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world.  It is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.Part two is about an adult Grania who falls in love with a hearing man named Jim.  Jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest.  I found his conversations with Grania dull and their romance a bit sappy.  My mind began to wander.Part three follows Jim as he enters World War One and the fighting he experiences or sees.  This created a problem for me, as I said earlier, Jim just didn\'t hold my interest.Part one seemed a novel all of its own.  The style changed after that.

Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania\'s voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap.  Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using.  When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex.  By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania\'s ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium.  Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share.  In Jim\'s traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming:  pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers.  As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes.  The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends.  Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying.  As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania\'s silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader.  Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot;  Mary Whipple", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Graceful and original treatment of man\'s oldest themes.", "unixReviewTime": 1064361600, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2003"}\n', '{"reviewerID": "A1Z1F8JP032EV2", "asin": "0002005395", "reviewerName": "Patti \\"PattisPages\\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "The title may be Deafening, but the book is anything but.

This book was just too slow-paced for me and the characters too one-dimensional.  Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault.  More complex is Grania\'s sister Tress, who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional.  Another interesting character is their mother, who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible, while she battles her guilt over Grania\'s hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests.  However, the author doesn\'t fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother, and we are left with a love story between two very nice people.  Jim\'s story is more disturbing than Grania\'s, actually, as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis.

And it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in World War I. The novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.Grania O\'Neill -- the name is an anglicization of the Irish for \\"love\\" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. She wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. She has an ally in her grandmother Mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. But I found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into Grania\'s world. I was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.As a young adult, Grania falls in love and marries. But it is 1915, and her husband Jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. The unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as Sebastian Faulks\'BIRDSONG. And the scenes back in Canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. But the fact remains that there is an ocean between Grania and Jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. Still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and Grania teaches him once more to talk.This is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence. It calls for an almost abstract style that can handle ideas and sensations rather than events -- poetry rather than prose.

Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the \\"abnormal\\".  The young, autistic Christopher in \\"Curious Incident\\" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It\'s a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there\'s no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O\'Brien\'s early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?Grania, who would have been \\"Grainne\\" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she\'s coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It\'s important that Grania \\"blend in\\" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania\'s only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.All of Mamo\'s dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can\'t force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a \\"Deaf School\\".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania\'s progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania\'s life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There\'s no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There\'s a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania\'s reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier\'s wives need more visibility and Itani\'s effort is commendable.This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania\'s life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.

It is interesting to me that many of the reviews focus on his chapter on Milk.  I didn\'t take that much from that chapter, but simply that the verdict isn\'t really out on Milk.  I think he would have done better to address the question of raw or pasteurized--another big subject of debate.  But, that logically must come from the belief first that milk is good for you and I didn\'t really feel that he made a decisive decision about it though he leaned more towards milk than away from it.There were several things I enjoyed about this book.  I enjoyed learning a lot of nutritional history--like the history of vitamins and how different things in our food (like canola oil) were developed.  There were also interesting chapters about various vitamins.  I now finally understand why there are vitamins B6 and B12, but not B7 and B8 (they were originally named and then discarded because people realized they had no nutritional value).  There was a very interesting (to me) chapter about detox diets and the lack of scientific evidence that they do any good.  In fact, there is no evidence that there are health benefits to them.But, the reason I haven\'t given it 4 or 5 stars, is that the author leans heavily towards the opinion that chemicals in our food is just fine.  Even given his scientific evidence, I am not fully persuaded.  Many of the things he talked about haven\'t been around for years, so we don\'t know their long term effects.  It was just this year that several reports were published stating that artificial sweeteners are digested the same as regular sugar and do not contribute to weightloss.  Which, by the way, I was very surprised that he didn\'t talk about Splenda at all but he did talk about other artificial sweeteners.

It\'s what you know for sure that just ain\'t so.\\"  If (some of) the reviews for this book are any indication, Dr. Joe was right: scientific scrutiny is unlikely to change anyone\'s mind.  People continue to smoke, people continue to eat mostly red meat, etc.  Those people who eat red meat and smoke are often willing to admit they are participating in unhealthy behaviour.  So much more, then, is it difficult or impossible to convince people through the scientific literature that their preconceived notions are not correct when the topic is not something for which literally billions of people have served as experimental subjects (through their normal activities).  That is an observation that is mostly independent of the book\'s qualities as prose and entertainment, but it does identify the point from which this book starts.In a series of bite-sized chapters (3-5 pages), Schwarcz takes us through some of the topics he\'s encountered and researched in his role as a science commentator over the last 30 (?) years.  As such, I would suggest that the topics are a little skewed to the supplements side - there are many chapters devoted to particular dietary supplements with supposedly miraculous effects (to cure cancer, lose weight, etc.).  These claims are usually laughably easy to dismiss because the \\"evidence\\" of their efficacy is non-existent.  The book is much more interesting when he tackles issues of pesticides, teflon, and artificial sweeteners.  Generally, the scientific literature shows that the amounts of these items in an average diet are so small as to be non-issues.  Sure, they cause cancer - in amounts millions of times as large as humans take in.  And these amounts are far less than the naturally occurring carcinogens that we are exposed to automatically because we breath and eat food.  This leads to the primary thesis of the book, with which no nutritional expert could argue: eat a good balanced diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.This thesis is proven again and again throughout the book, and the primary problem of this book is its repetative nature.  In trying to keep each chapter reasonably autonomous, and because the conclusions are virtually the same each time, the author cannot possibly make the book entertaining for long reading times.  It\'s more of a \\"pick up, read a bit, put down for a couple days\\" kind of book.Other reviewers have objected to the lack of footnotes.  This is a valid criticism; I suppose it was a conscious choice on the author\'s and editor\'s parts (for ease of readability).  Certainly I would have prefered if the studies he cites were more clearly referenced.  (Rise and Fall of the Third Reich had thousands of references, so it\'s insulting to think that the reader would pass on buying the book simply because they are in there, especially as this book\'s raison d\'etre is to bring to the public the objective scientific conclusions on the nutritional questions raised in the book).  I would add the criticism that two hot-button nutritional issues are not dealt with.  (1) Bisphenol-A, a monomer used in polycarbonate synthesis, has been banned by Health Canada and others, but ruled safe (in the amounts present in polycarbonate drinking and storage vessels) by the FDA.  Based on the number of articles I see (in newspapers and even the American Chemical Society\'s magazine), this chemical is perfectly positioned for the Dr. Joe treatment, and I find it curious that it is omitted.  (2) Perhaps because this movement has only gained real traction since the book was written it was not included, but the \\"eat local\\" mantra is in conflict with the \\"eat lots of variety\\" mantra espoused by nutritionists and featured prominently in the book.  If you live in a breadbasket (e.g. California), you can have a widely varied diet throughout the year.  If you live in a northern clime (e.g. northern Minnesota, most of Canada), you will not have access to locally grown fresh fruit and veggies for most of the year.  Eating as Dr. Schwarcz suggests would leave you with an enormous carbon footprint due to the transportation and refrigeration costs of moving the food from southern locations.It is also curious that Dr. Joe never mentions the placebo effect.  Some remedies are effective because the patient thinks they will be effective.  Sure, double-blind studies take this into account (people receiving the placebo and the test compound are both going to benefit from the placebo effect, so any additional effect in the test group will be due to the efficacy of the test compound), but anecdotal \\"evidence\\" is easy to accumulate by charletons, and these testamonials can certainly be true!  If you\'re one of the lucky ones whose cancer goes into remission at the same time as you started drinking three litres of acai juice a day, you will certainly \\"know\\" that the acai juice caused the remission.  So it\'s my unfortunate conclusion that Dr. Joe is singing to the choir with this book - those with a scientific/statistical background will be convinced, but we were convinced anyways.  Those who are the statistical outliers will still be convinced of their positions, and the charletans will continue to make money off of them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Some neat tidbits, but it\'s somewhat repetative and unfortunately it\'s unlikely to change anyone\'s mind", "unixReviewTime": 1257120000, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2009"}\n', '{"reviewerID": "A226MYSFCQE6G6", "asin": "0002007649", "reviewerName": "Deb", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "\\"Phew!

Judging by this book I\'m thinking he should stick to chemistry.I\'m not saying that Schwarcz\'s dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you\'ve been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don\'t overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?I majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can\'t really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about \\"the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat.\\" Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be \\"an occasional treat,\\" and even then the portion size \\"should cover a small portion of the plate.\\" Those people who still believe in the \\"myth\\" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz\'s book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.I can\'t forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn\'t address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn\'t offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry\'s number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that \\"Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy.\\" Schwarcz responds by saying, \\"True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle.\\" He leaves it at that, and he doesn\'t bother to say what parts of the \\"very different diet and lifestyle\\" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses\' Health Study \\"which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures.\\" Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who \\"criticizes\\" milk consumption as part of the \\"antimilk lobby,\\" driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I\'m not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we \\"look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium.\\" Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn\'t offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses \\"antimilk\\" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He\'s missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).This is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we\'re supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that \\"leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.\\"? I\'d say it\'s a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk \\"is not a poison,\\" as some fringe members of PETA might say.In conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations.

I\'ve purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled \\"Milk and Calcium\\", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a \\"nutrition authority\\".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he\'d written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk\'s health benefits.Don\'t Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World\'s Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, \\"Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!\\" He fails to acknowledge the theory that\'s becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow\'s milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, \\"But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture\\".\\"The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning.\\"( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the \\"breast milk\\" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) \\"That\'s hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.\\"He tries to refute the Nurse\'s Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow\'s milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse\'s Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this \\"self-selected subgroup\\". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a \\"trace of dioxin\\". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn\'t get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There\'s no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow\'s milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring \\"water\\" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, \\"A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.\\"Of course he\'s not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn\'t bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author\'s explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow\'s milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their \\"natural\\" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow\'s milk, it\'s important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal\'s living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while \\"milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA\\".Webster\'s Dictionary defines poison as, \\"a substance that through it\'s chemical action can injure or kill\\".It\'s debatable whether cow\'s milk, as it\'s generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While \\"milk and calcium\\" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility.

Jacob, a young adult, naive, still a virgin, unused to such a hard life on the road, confronts danger, murder, hatred, love, callous human viciousness, more danger, and finds friends and allies (not all of them human) in the unlikeliest of places.The story is told in turn, by the nonogenarian Jacob now in a nursing home, and at other times, by the twenty-something Jacob working at the circus and trying not to get killed -- mostly at the hands of his fellow-human-associates. Every chapter is an adventure, held my attention and took turns gladdening, saddening and surprising me.The circus animals also get into the act in this book and the author\'s sensitive rendering and treatment of them makes them all the more vivid, as \\"supporting actors\\",  Circus \\"employees\\", and fellow participants in the intrigue and action.A masterful ending -- leaving the reader with hope, glee and wonder.

I\'m not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book. From the prologue, this book held my attention. Gruen\'s writing style and attention to detail is simply amazing! At several points, I felt as though I was actually watching the show or walking beside Jacob while working in the menagerie. It felt real. And the perverse, morbid sense of humor she gives Jacob as an elderly gentleman is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Although, I must admit, I found myself fuming over the treatment of our senior citizens. That, however, is a rant for another time!The characters in this book are so rich and deep. It was hard not to form some sort of fondness for them. In addition, I found it amazing that Gruen was able to turn Rosie into a full character without completely humanizing her. Even though I have a strong bond to animals, I still felt a close connection to Rosie.From a lot of her terminology, knowledge of trains, animals, freaks, etc., I really think that Gruen did a lot of research before writing this book. It makes it a lot more authoritative and realistic. While the story itself is fiction, it makes it that much more believable and credible to be interspersed with fact.I will say that the happy ending, Jacob\'s extreme sensitivity, etc. might be seen as extremely campy. However, I felt that Gruen was trying to find something positive during the Depression. I feel that she did try to capture that, even though there was food a shelter, life on a train circus was not good either. The Depression was hard on everyone, and no one was left unaffected. So, while there was romanticizing occurring in the novel, it felt as though she was trying to make a fairytale in an unlikely setting. To me, that makes it even more endearing and tender. Many reviews I have read complain that she is trying to push an agenda with some of the issues she tackles, but, to me, this was just a romantic love story of two people finding each other against all odds.

We are first presented with Jacob Jankowski as an elderly man in a nursing home. The old coot may have problems with his short-term memory, but he certainly has a terrific long-term memory when it comes to remembering the details of his youthful days in a travelling circus. I thought that I had no interest whatsoever in the workings of a depression-era circus, including the care of the exotic animals and the various freaks and acts. However, the author depicts this unique microcosm of humanity with such passion and color that I found myself absolutely absorbed in the story early on.Adding to the historic ambience of this saga are the well-chosen photographs at the start of each chapter: a man with a deformed human growing from his stomach; a woman proudly showing off her bare upper extremities; excited people milling around the big top...It is the undercurrent of spiritual darkness that makes this story fly so high. Gruen depicts the battle between good and evil with stunning accuracy: the greed of Uncle Al; the brutality of August; the surprising kindness of the abandonned dwarf, Walter; and the meek vulnerability of Marlena and her animals.The scene with the drunkard Camel being told that he is dying of poisoning from Jamacai ginger extract is poignant. This, followed by scenes with Camel being cared for in a box car by Walter and Jacob. Stirring, because alternating chapters depict a now elderly Jacob in a similar position of helplessness.In sum, a GREAT book. Whoever thought that an elephant would carry such literary weight?

You don\'t just visualize the author\'s words, they leap off the page, and rather than watching the movie in your mind, you are living it. You feel the pain, the joy, the laughter. When the book is finished, you\'re more than disappointed. You feel invigorated, and you search eagerly through the author\'s books to see what, along the same vein, she has to offer. You search readers\' recommendations to find the books that leave the same imprint on you. Inevitably, though the books satiate your appetite, they don\'t resonate in the same way. Welcome to Sara Gruen\'s Water for Elephants.In the prologue, we\'re privy to a murder. We see it as Jacob sees it, and tries in vain to stop it. Though the victim and murderer aren\'t named, as we\'re introduced to them, it becomes clear in our mind who filled those roles.Then we start from the beginning, in the midst of the Great Depression. Jacob is in class, during the final few weeks at Cornell preparing for his finals before he becomes a doctor of veterinary medicine.In a moment, the Dean will enter and change his path. Jacob was to go home and set up shop with his father, working with the animals in his town. Instead, he goes home to identify the remains of his mother and father. He sees the sign his father added to their on-site practice: Jankowitz and Son Veterinary Practice. After identifying his family, he visits the lawyer, who tells him he has nothing. The bank owns the house and everything in it. The explanation as to why his parents mortgaged the house shatters him. He returns to school to finish his finals and finds that he can\'t.Jacob flees and seeing a train pass, tries to jump aboard. Once on, he realizes it is a circus train. An old man, Camel, vouches for him and works to get him a job within.As soon as the boss finds he is Ivy League educated, degree or no degree, he becomes the animal man. With such a prestigious job within, he straddles the division between the higher ups and performers, and the lower echelon who helped secure his place.One performer in particular, Marlena, fascinates him. She reminds him physically of the girl he left behind at school, and emotionally captivates him. She matches his love of animals. Married to August, who has the boss\' ear, she is off-limits, but a friendship develops anyway.Later comes Rosie, an elephant pilfered from a circus that has gone defunct. Rosie suffers August\'s wrath many, many times. Jacob is stunned by her human like qualities. Understanding, pain, anger, empathy, happiness all emanate from her big brown eyes.Following the story, I felt all of the emotions Rosie feels (except perhaps, the pain). Astonishment at the goings on to keep the circus running smoothly. The love Jacob develops for many people who help him in the course of creating a new life for himself, free of the memories surrounding his past. Sadness at the loss of animals, anger at the treatment of the animals and the red lighting of, as they\'re called today, carnies.The characters came alive to me, as did the setting. As soon as I finished this book, I eagerly went to Sara Gruen\'s website to read excerpts of other novels she had written. While good, they didn\'t capture me the way this did. And I wanted more of this. So I went to Amazon\'s recommendations Disappointedly, I moved on to Barnes and Noble. No dice. So I tried the next best thing. Research. I wanted to read first hand accounts of the circus the way it was back then. The more I read, the more I craved.Then, as though they knew my hunger, work offered me discounted tickets to the circus. I\'m still debating. On the one hand, it\'s the circus. Elephants that feel things like people do! Horses that synchronize! How can I say no? On the other hand, it\'s not the 1920s. It\'s almost 100 years later. What if it\'s not the same? I mean true, we\'re in the middle of a depression (point 4 of pros: It\'s almost the same!). But people are categorically different than they were then. Theoretically, this extends to performers as well right?But alas, I have chosen to forego the circus at this moment, because I fear, like the recommendations of Barnes and Noble and Amazon, it may fall short. So I will hold onto the satisfaction this book gave me, and the hunger for more of the same. Hopefully, there will be another book that catches my attention like this one.

It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm.

What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It\'s never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn\'t tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own \\"love\\" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don\'t want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers.

For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed.  You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz).

We are also switching back into his current reality where he is re-living these days from the nursing home that he now resides in.There are good plot points throughout, and I did find myself wanting to get back to the book to see what happens next. At times, however, I found certain events did not play out in a way that was realistic to the story that was being built. Even though I was enjoying the story and the narrative - I found myself aware of the fact that there was an author behind it all, pulling the strings. Not being able to quite put my finger on why, I was often pulled out of believing the story, almost as if the author was showing too many fingerprints of the process of writing. For this reason - it was hard for me to get lost completely in the book itself.All of that aside, however, I still found it beautiful. There was a moment in particular when I felt incredibly sad for our main character - to the point where I had to put the book down and step away for a moment to collect myself. There is a wonderfully commentary woven throughout that allows the reader to ponder where one is at when you are looking back at your life in old age. I really enjoyed that thread.I had heard a lot of really good things about the book, and was going into it that way.

The striptease and gigantic breasts are described in vivid detail. Jacob\'s horror, amazement, and embarassment, having never seen a naked woman before shows he\'s really not in Kansas any more. That\'s the most explicit scene and it\'s really hilarious. There are a few other sexual situations, often mixed with drinking. The actual love making was left to the imagination.

I found it very easy to read and get lost in the story. I liked how it was told from present-day Jacob\'s view looking back on his life. This helped me understand what type of man he was. I felt like I was there will him throughout this story. The setting of the Great Depression made the struggles and triumphs mean so much more. I found all the main characters; Jacob, August, Marlena, Walter, and even the elephant, Rosie, to be extremely poignant, especially when you remember the story is told from an elderly Jacob. The transitions from \\"memories\\" to \\"current day\\" Jacob were very smooth and I didn\'t feel distracted or lost during these changes.

I thought it was going to be some horrible account of the circus life and have no substance. Boy was I wrong. The protagonist Jacob leaves his exams to become a vet after learning of the death of his parents and literally jumps aboard a train not knowing what kind of train it is or the kind of people on it. I guess you have to just take the biggest risks in life sometimes and do what does not make sense to reap the biggest rewards.I am anxiously awaiting the movie to come out in April!
